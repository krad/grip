# grip

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/krad/grip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/krad/grip)

grip is a collection of structures meant to encapsulate audio / video data.  These structures have been pulled from various krad projects to prevent reuse across media libraries.

these structures can be used to packetize audio / video data.

as we begin supporting more protocols across the tools, we'll add support for the structures those protocols interact with here.
